            <p>
                Also known as Mooncake festival, the Mid-Autumn Festival is a cultural festive celebrated by the Chinese in China, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Singapore. 
                It is celebrated every year on August 15 of the Lunar calendar. During the festive, members of a family will reunite together and enjoy the festive together.
                Usually, there would be a moon-viewing party where people would enjoy the beautiful full moon while sipping some tea and eating some moon cakes (Tan. B., n.d). 
                However in Taiwan, people would usually go barbeque with their family or friends to celebrate this festive (OFTaiwan, n.d).
